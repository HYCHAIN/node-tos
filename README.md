## HYCHAIN GUARDIAN NODE SOFTWARE AGREEMENT
 
Effective Date: March 2nd, 2024

Please read this Guardian Node Software Agreement (this “Agreement”) carefully before using the HYCHAIN network (the “HYCHAIN Network”) Guardian Node software (the “Node Software”). By checking the box “I agree,” or otherwise accessing or using the Node Software or purchasing, accessing, or using a non-fungible token upgrade key for the Node Software (“Key”), you agree that you have read, understand, and accept all the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement by and between you and Hytopia, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in the State of Washington (“Company,” “we,” “our,” and their derivatives). 

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO YOU. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE NODE SOFTWARE OR PURCHASE, ACCESS, OR USE A KEY. 

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION. IF YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND COMPANY AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT INDIVIDUALLY OR AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION. 

Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible to access or use the Node Software or purchase, access or use a Key, you must satisfy each of the following eligibility requirements:

You are at least eighteen (18) years of age, or are the age of majority in the country in which you reside to enter into legally binding agreements under applicable law; and 

You are not, nor are you an entity that is, or an entity owned or controlled by any person or entity that is, or conducting any activities itself or on behalf of any person or entity that is: the subject of any sanctions administered or enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over the party; identified on the Denied Persons, Entity, or Unverified Lists of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security; or located, organized, or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the subject of economic sanctions, including, without limitation, Russia, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or Syria (each, a “Restricted Person”). 

Node Software

Use of Node Software. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may use the Node Software to operate a HYCHAIN Network Guardian Node on one or more machines that you own or control. The HYCHAIN Network is a “layer-2” network that operates on top of the “layer-1” Ethereum blockchain. As a Guardian Node operator, you will be able to help ensure that the correct state of the HYCHAIN Network is reflected on the Ethereum blockchain by reading assertion data from the rollup protocol on the “layer-1” network, submitting state roots of upcoming assertions to confirm the accuracy of information being submitted by Guardian Nodes on the HYCHAIN Network, and utilizing a Wallet (defined below) to perform assertion checks on the “layer-1” network. Use of Ethereum is subject to separate third-party terms and conditions.

Key Requirement. You must purchase a Key from the Company in order to operate a Guardian Node and earn Network Rewards (defined below). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Key will upgrade your Node Software and allow you to earn $TOPIA token rewards. You must purchase additional Keys to operate multiple HYCHAIN Network Guardian Nodes. You may purchase a Key at https://nodes.hychain.com. 

Connecting a Digital Wallet. In order to operate a Guardian Node using the Node Software, you will need to connect a compatible third-party Ethereum blockchain digital wallet (“Wallet”). You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Wallet, including any associated credentials, private key, and seed phrase. The Company does not offer Wallet software or custody $TOPIA Tokens (or any other crypto assets) on behalf of Node Software users. Your use of a third-party Wallet is subject to separate terms and conditions established by the Wallet provider.

Network Rewards and Slashing. You may receive units of $TOPIA Tokens from the HYCHAIN Network as a reward for contributing to the security of the HYCHAIN Network (“Network Rewards”). All such Network Rewards are programmatically distributed to Guardian Node operators by the HYCHAIN Network. $TOPIA Tokens will accrue on the “layer-2” HYCHAIN network and can be “bridged” or transferred to the Ethereum network through a HYCHAIN Network bridge for use on the Ethereum Network if desired. Additionally, some or all of your earned $TOPIA Tokens may be programmatically destroyed as a penalty imposed by the HYCHAIN Network (a “Slashing Penalty”) in certain instances. Please refer to the HYCHAIN Network documentation for more details. The Company is not responsible or liable for any Network Rewards or Slashing Penalties that result from your use of the Node Software. The Company will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Wallet or as a result of any cyber incident or security vulnerability that impacts your Wallet.

Node Software Updates. The Node Software may automatically download or prompt you to download and install updates onto your machine from time to time. By accessing or using the Node Software, you agree that the Company may download and install automatic Node Software updates onto your machine. You may opt out of automatic updates by adjusting your Node Software settings.

Limited License to Use the Node Software

Node Software License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free, limited license to install, use, and run the Node Software on one or more machines that you own or control. No right, title, or interest in or to the Node Software is transferred to you, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved by the Company. Any use of the Node Software not expressly permitted by this Agreement is a breach of this Agreement.

Third-Party Licenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Node Software may contain software components released under separate open-source or business-source license terms, in which case those license terms will govern such software components.

Disclaimer of Warranties 

YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE NODE SOFTWARE AND HYCHAIN NETWORK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE NODE SOFTWARE AND HYCHAIN NETWORK AND ALL SOFTWARE, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE NODE SOFTWARE AND HYCHAIN NETWORK ARE EACH PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS-AVAILABLE” BASIS.

Indemnification

You agree, at your own expense, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective owners, members, agents, directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, representatives, affiliates, successors, and assigns (collectively, “Company Parties”) from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with your breach of this Agreement, your violation of any law or regulation, or your use of the Node Software. The Company reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with the Company in asserting any available defense.

If you have a dispute with one or more users of the Node Software or other third parties, you release the Company Parties from all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees of every kind and nature arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

Binding Individual Arbitration 

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

You and the Company agree that Disputes (defined below) will be settled by binding, individual arbitration conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Agreement.

Disputes We Agree to Arbitrate. You and the Company agree to submit all Disputes between you and the Company to individual binding arbitration. “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and the Company that relates to this Agreement, Node Software, or HYCHAIN Network, including, without limitation, the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Section 10.

You and the Company agree to arbitrate all Disputes regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory. You and the Company agree that whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration under this Agreement will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.

Arbitration Procedure. To start an arbitration, review the JAMS Rules and follow the instructions for initiating an arbitration on the JAMS website. The party starting an arbitration must send JAMS a “Demand for Arbitration” (available on its website), pay a filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party. Prior to commencement of the arbitration, the parties will meet in good faith for the purpose of resolving the dispute.

The arbitration will be conducted by a single JAMS arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving cryptocurrency or commercial-contract disputes. You and the Company both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement. If an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place in King County, Washington.

The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless You and the Company agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions. The arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by you or the Company to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). The arbitrator may not award relief against the Company respecting any person other than you. Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by a state or federal court located in King County, Washington.

Time Limitation to File. If a Dispute must be arbitrated, you or the Company must start arbitration of the Dispute within one (1) year from when the Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than one (1) year after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. The Company encourages you to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. The failure to provide timely notice will bar all claims.

Confidentiality. The parties will keep confidential the existence of the arbitration, the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the arbitrator’s decision, except (a) as necessary to prepare for and conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits; (b) in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an arbitrator’s decision or its enforcement; (c) the Company may disclose the arbitrator’s decision in confidential settlement negotiations; (d) each party may disclose as necessary to professional advisors that are subject to a strict duty of confidentiality; and (e) as applicable law otherwise requires. The parties, witnesses, and arbitrator will treat as confidential and will not disclose to any third person (other than witnesses or experts) any documentary or other evidence produced in any arbitration, except as applicable so requires or if the evidence was obtained from the public domain or was otherwise obtained independently from the arbitration.

Governing Law. All matters relating to the Node Software, the HYCHAIN Network, or this Agreement and any related Dispute will be solely and exclusively governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Prevailing Party. In any Dispute, the arbitrator will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and legal fees awards will be offset.

Injunctions. Any material breach by you of this Agreement could cause the Company irreparable harm for which it has no adequate remedies at law. Accordingly, the Company is entitled to seek specific performance or injunctive relief for any such breach. Nothing in this Section 10 will preclude the Company from seeking specific performance or injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

Jury Waiver. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Node Software, or HYCHAIN Network.

CLASS ACTION WAIVER

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO ONLY BRING DISPUTES IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND WILL NOT SEEK TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR ANY OTHER ACTION WHERE ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY ACTS IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY (E.G., PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS).

Termination

We may terminate your access to and use of the Node Software, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. Upon termination of this Agreement, you must immediately cease all use of the Node Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Node Software. 

This Section 12 (Termination) and Sections 4 (Intellectual Property), 6 (Risks), 7 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 8 (Limitation of Lability), 9 (Indemnification), 10 (Binding Individual Arbitration), 11 (Class Action Waiver), and 13 (General Provisions) will survive such termination.

General Provisions

The Company may provide you with notice and other communications via electronic communications. You may provide us with notice by sending an email address to support@hychain.com. All notices will be deemed effective upon dispatch.

Waivers. For a waiver to be deemed effective, the waiver must be in a writing signed by the Company. No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in this Agreement will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Cumulative Rights. The rights and remedies of the parties under this Agreement are cumulative, and each party may exercise any of its rights and enforce any of its remedies under this Agreement, along with all other rights and remedies available to it at law, in equity, or otherwise. 

Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is declared to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein will not be affected thereby, and the remainder of the provisions of this Agreement will remain valid, legal, and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Force Majeure. The Company will have no liability for any failure or delay resulting from any condition beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, governmental action or acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood, or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, equipment failures, and Internet or blockchain network disturbances.

Successors and Assigns. You may not transfer or assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, and any such attempted assignment will be void. The Company reserves the right to freely transfer or assign this Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder to any third party at any time without your consent and prior notice to you. If you object to any such transfer or assignment, you may stop accessing and using the Node Software.
