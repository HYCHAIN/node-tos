SECTION 8 INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WHICH REQUIRES, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. 

THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 10.3.

Eligibility Requirements.

General. To be eligible to access or use the Node Software or purchase, access or use a Key, you must satisfy each of the following eligibility requirements:

You are at least eighteen (18) years of age, or are the legal age for entering legally binding agreements under applicable law;

You are not, nor are you an entity that is, or an entity owned or controlled by any person or entity that is, or conducting any activities itself or on behalf of any person or entity that is: the subject of any sanctions administered or enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over the party; identified on the Denied Persons, Entity or Unverified Lists of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security; or located, organized or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the subject of economic sanctions, including, without limitation, Russia, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea or Syria (each, a “Restricted Person”); and

Node Software.

Use of Node. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may use the Node Software to operate a HYCHAIN Network Guardian Node on one or more machines that you own or control. The HYCHAIN Network is a “layer-2” network that operates on top of the “layer-1” Ethereum blockchain. As a Guardian Node operator, you will be able to help ensure that the correct state of the HYCHAIN Network is reflected on the Ethereum blockchain by reading assertion data from the rollup protocol on the “layer-1” network, submitting state roots of upcoming assertions to confirm the accuracy of information being submitted by Guardian Nodes on the HYCHAIN Network, and utilizing a Wallet (defined below) to perform assertion checks on the “layer-1” network. Use of Ethereum is subject to separate third-party terms and conditions.

Key Requirement. You must purchase a Key from the Company in order to operate a Guardian Node and earn Network Rewards (defined below). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Key will upgrade your Node Software and allow you to earn $TOPIA token rewards. You must purchase additional Keys to operate multiple HYCHAIN Network Guardian Nodes. You may purchase a Key at https://nodes.hychain.com. 

Connecting a Digital Wallet. In order to operate a Guardian Node using the Node Software, you will need to connect a compatible third-party Ethereum blockchain digital wallet (“Wallet”). You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Wallet, including any associated credentials, private key and seed phrase. The Company does not offer Wallet software or custody $TOPIA Tokens (or any other crypto assets) on behalf of Node Software users. Your use of a third-party Wallet is subject to separate terms and conditions established by the Wallet provider.

Network Rewards; Slashing. You may receive units of $TOPIA Tokens from the HYCHAIN Network as a reward for contributing to the security of the HYCHAIN Network (“Network Rewards”). All such Network Rewards are programmatically distributed to Guardian Node operators by the HYCHAIN Network. $TOPIA Tokens will accrue on the “layer-2” HYCHAIN network and can be “bridged” or transferred to the Ethereum network through a HYCHAIN Network bridge for use on the Ethereum Network if desired. Additionally, some or all of your earned $TOPIA Tokens may be programmatically destroyed as a penalty imposed by the HYCHAIN Network (a “Slashing Penalty”) in certain instances. Please refer to the HYCHAIN Network documentation for more details. The Company is not responsible or liable for any Network Rewards or Slashing Penalties that result from your use of the Node Software. The Company shall not be liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Wallet or as a result of any cyber incident or security vulnerability that impacts your Wallet.

Node Software Updates. The Node Software may automatically download or prompt you to download and install updates onto your machine from time to time. By accessing or using the Node Software, you agree that the Company may download and install automatic Node Software updates onto your machine. You may opt out of automatic updates by adjusting your Node Software settings.

Dispute Resolution: Agreement to Arbitrate.

All disputes, claims and controversies, whether based on past, present or future events, arising out of or relating to statutory or common law claims, the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of any provision of the Agreement, and the determination of the scope or applicability of your agreement to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy originating from the Agreement, will be determined by binding arbitration in Delaware, USA, before a single arbitrator.

The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of Delaware, excluding its conflict or choice of law rules.

Nothing in the Agreement will preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

A party must notify the other party of its intent to commence arbitration prior to commencing arbitration. The notice must specify the date on which the arbitration demand is intended to be filed, which must be at least thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. During this time period, the parties will meet for the purpose of resolving the dispute prior to commencing arbitration.

Subject to Section 8.4, each party may commence arbitration by providing to the appropriate Delaware legal institutions and the other party to the dispute a written demand for arbitration, stating the subject of the dispute and the relief requested.

Subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability stated in the Agreement, the appointed arbitrators may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the laws of Delaware, USA. In making a determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term of the Agreement. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned, written decision with respect to the dispute to each party, who will promptly act in accordance with the arbitrator’s decision. Any award (including interim or final remedies) may be confirmed in or enforced by a state or federal court located in Delaware, USA. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review.

The party initiating the arbitration is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the costs of the attendance of the arbitration reporter at the arbitration hearing and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any arbitration arising out of or relating to the Agreement, the arbitrator will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and legal fees awards will be offset.

The parties will keep confidential the existence of the arbitration, the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the arbitrator’s decision, except (a) as necessary to prepare for and conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits; (b) in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an arbitrator’s decision or its enforcement; (c) the Company may disclose the arbitrator’s decision in confidential settlement negotiations; (d) each party may disclose as necessary to professional advisors that are subject to a strict duty of confidentiality; and (e) as applicable law otherwise requires. The parties, witnesses and arbitrator will treat as confidential and will not disclose to any third person (other than witnesses or experts) any documentary or other evidence produced in any arbitration, except as applicable so requires or if the evidence was obtained from the public domain or was otherwise obtained independently from the arbitration.

If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to the Agreement.
